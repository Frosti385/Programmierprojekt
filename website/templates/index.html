    <h2 >Project description</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to classify six caterogies of trash. The categories are cardboard, paper, glass, plastic and trash. 
        To classify a picture of trash( only JPGs are allowed) uploaded via the website / API Endpoint a neural network is used. This neural network is based on resnet-152 a free to use pretrained neural network, which is used to preclassify the given image. Afterwards a much smaller network maps the result of the first network of the six trash categories and gives a prediction of the type of trash the picture displays.
        Thanks to the pretrained network and tuning of this and the mapping network an accuracy of 95% (95,6%) is reached.

    <h2 >Project Management</h2>
    <p>
        The project is implemented in three sprints. Management is carried out via Jira.
        The link can be found in the Documentation handend out.

    <h2>Access via Frontend</h2>
    <p>
        The frontend of this application is available via
        the given URL in the Documentation provided separately.
    </p>
    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <p>
        The API is deployed via a CI/CD pipeline using github actions.
        With the deployment of new changes the main python file is tested 
        and afterwards pushed to the server 
    </p>
    <p>Both the linting and code validity is checked before doing so.</p>
    <p>Only after the build step is completed the deploy step begins</p>
    <p>The three relevant enpoints are as follows:</p>
    
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        git clone
        <a href="https://github.com/Frosti385/Programmierprojekt.git"
          >https://github.com/Frosti385/Programmierprojekt.git</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>pip install virtualenv</li>
      <li>python -m venv env</li>
      <li>.\evn\Scripts\activate</li>
      <li>pip3 install -r .\requirements.txt</li>
    </ol>
    <h3">Run API</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>python .\main.py</li>
    </ol>
    <h3">Classify a picture</h3>
    <p>(The passcode is given separately)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Call the website (under the given URL on the server or if your are running the script locally under localhost:5000)</li>
      <li>In the upload mask you need to type in the passcode to be able to upload a file</li>
      <li>After selecting a JPG file of trash click the "Submit"- Button</li>
      <li>You will be redirected to a loading page. </li>
      <li>After the process of predicting is finished the type of trash
          shown on the picture you will be redirected to the resultpage and your result is displayed
      </li>
    </ol>
